One to One Mapping
------------------------------------
we will take Order and the Address(billing Address) entities to perform One to One mapping.
Each Order has exactly one Address and each Address belongs to one order.
On the database level, this mapped by a foreign key column either on the address or the order table.

the @OneToOne JPA annotation is used to map the source entity with the target entity.

Note -The one-to-one mapping/association can be either unidirectional or bidirectional .
1. In unidirectional association, source entity has a relationship field that refers to the target entity
   and the source entity's table contains the foreign key.
2. In bidirectional association, each entity(i.e. source and target) has a relationship field that refers
   to each other and the target entity's table contains the foreign key. The source entity must
   use the mappedBy attribute to define the bidirectional one-to-one mapping.
